// Host share of routed MoE misses (GGML_CUDA_MOE_CPU_SHARE=<GPU fraction of misses>, default 0.4).
// A doorbell kernel publishes the layer's routed experts and activations to mapped
// host memory; host workers compute a share of the missing experts end to end
// (up/gate, GLU, down) from the host weights while the GPU streams the rest over
// the bus. The routed matvecs skip the host entries; the weighted reduction that
// follows the down waits for the host and reads its rows in their place.
// The doorbell / host-computed-miss design follows Strata (github.com/Niko1221/Strata, MIT).
